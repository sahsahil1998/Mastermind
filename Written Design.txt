Final Project: Design Explanation
'''

I started working on the project by breaking it into small pieces. The first step I did was 
create some functions that will generate a randomly ordered set of colors for the answer 
and then figure out how the cows and bulls worked. Once I completed those two functions I began
thinking on how to design the game board. I began writing it out procederually and the code for 
just drawing the 3 squares and circles was too long and utilized some global turtles so I scratched
that idea. I examined the Marble class and realized I could create a class for the game to run through 
and have methods for all the things I needed because the Marble class not only draws the circles 
but can set colors and create instances for the turtle so I used that to start creating my Mastermind class
and used the blueprint from the Marble to add draw squares. To draw all the circles, there is a few seperate
methods that is finally all pulled into "draw_ten_rows_of_all_circles". I needed seperate classes to pull and 
check the coords for the guess circles and the gifs also so if the user clicks within these regions, the 
needed action would occur.

Once I completed setting up the gameboard, I began creating methods that actually runs through the game. 
In once method, before the checking cows and bulls loop begins, I generate a answer for the game then it updates
the small circles to the far right depending on if the guess matches the generated answer and updates after each 
line of circles. If the count goes past 10, the user gets the lose gif to pop up but otherwise, the red and black 
circles that are filled will tell wether the color is in the correct position or not or if a different color is 
needed. Finally, the name and game score is stored in a seperate file and those contents are written onto the game
board using some file handling and the game driver is run through the main.
